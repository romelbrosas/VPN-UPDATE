"Dear Users,\n\nIf you are experiencing No Browse, or Connected but can't play videos, don't worry you are not alone, some users experience it too, it is due to Globe slow network in your area or maybe there is an ongoing globe maintenance, or you can try to do this step, i hope it helps.\n\nConnected but can't play videos? Try changing your server and navigate to Settings and turn on Forward DNS, thank you!\n\n- Admin💙"
